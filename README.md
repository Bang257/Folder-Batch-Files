# New-Folder-from-File
Personal repo to make my life easier making folders for my media. This repo will get a file name, move one level up in the file structure, create a new directory based on the file name, and move the file to this new directory

This .bat is meant to run from the  right-click->send-to context menu.

Instructions:

Download the .bat
Place it in a convenient location (that you will hopefully never need to see again)

Open command prompt
Navigate to the directory with the .bat file  (hint: cd "paste_of_the_path")
Type: COPY MYBACKUP.BAT "%USERPROFILE%\SendTo"

Now you can run the program at any time by right-clicking on the file, going to send-to, and selecting the program.
